/**
 * @brief A ROS2-control controller for Effort force control
 *
 * This controller implements 6-dimensional end effector force control for
 * robots with a wrist force-torque sensor.  Users command
 * geometry_msgs::msg::WrenchStamped targets to steer the robot in task space.  The
 * controller additionally listens to the specified force-torque sensor signals
 * and computes the superposition with the target wrench.
 *
 * The underlying solver maps this remaining wrench to joint motion.
 * Users can steer their robot with this control in free space. The speed of
 * the end effector motion is set with PD gains on each Effort axes.
 * In contact, the controller regulates the net force of the two wrenches to zero.
 *
 * Note that during free motion, users can generally set higher control gains
 * for faster motion.  In contact with the environment, however, normally lower
 * gains are required to maintain stability.  The ranges to operate in mainly
 * depend on the stiffness of the environment and the controller cycle of the
 * real hardware, such that some experiments might be required for each use
 * case.
